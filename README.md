## Key Benefits

- Builds user trust by promoting AI transparency.
- Helps websites comply with potential future AI transparency regulations.
- Simple setup with minimal code footprint.

## Features

- Easily integrates into any website.
- Displays a notification banner beside AI-generated content.
- Customizable appearance and message.

## Accessibility

The widget is designed with accessibility in mind. The modal dialog includes ARIA attributes to ensure that it is accessible to all users. The modal is also focus-trapped to prevent users from tabbing outside the modal. The badge and modal are keyboard accessible, and the modal can be closed using the escape key.

## Svelte as a Framework

The widget is built using Svelte, a modern web framework that compiles to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript. Svelte is a great choice for building web components and widgets due to its simplicity and performance. The widget is compiled to a standalone JavaScript file that can be easily included in any website.

The badge is a small clickable element that appears on the edge of the screen. It can be configured to appear in different positions:

- `top-right`
- `bottom-right`
- `top-left`
- `bottom-left`

## Information Modal

The information modal is a dialog that provides detailed information about the website's use of AI. It includes a title, body content, and sections that can be expanded to show more details. The modal is accessible and includes ARIA attributes and focus trapping to ensure a good user experience.

## Notice Element

![AGCN_screenshot_2](screenshots/screen2.png)

Notices are elements that can be placed anywhere on the page using the `data-ai-content` attribute. They display different types of notices based on the content provided in the configuration.

## Installation

You can include AGCN in your project by linking directly to the CDN or by downloading the script.

### CDN (Recommended)

Add this to your HTML before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/macnoc/AGCN@latest/dist/agcn.min.js"></script>
```

### Local Installation

1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/macnoc/AGCN).
2. Link to the script in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/agcn.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

To enable the widget, simply add the following JavaScript to your webpage:

```javascript
const widget = new AGCN();
```

This will create a new instance of the AGCN widget with the default configuration. The widget will automatically add the badge to the screen and display the modal when clicked.

You can customize the widget by passing a configuration object to the `AGCN` constructor. For example:

```javascript
const widget = new AGCN({
  config: {
    //...
  },
  content: {
    //...
  },
});
```

## Configuration

The widget can be configured using the following options:

- `config`: An object containing configuration options such as language, badge position, support, and whether to show the badge.

- `content`: An object containing the content to be displayed in the modal and notices. This includes the header, title, body, sections, and notices.

## Example

Here is an example of how to configure the widget with custom content:

```javascript
const widget = new AGCN({
    config: {
        language: "en",
        support: true,
        showBadge: true
    },
    content: {
        en: {
            header: "AI Contributions on This Page",
            title: "Our AI Helps Improve Your Experience",
            body: "This website uses AI to enhance the user experience. AI helps generate, modify, personalize, recommend, and assist in creating content.",
            sectionsHeader: "Below are some ways AI contributes to your experience:",
            sections: [
                {
                    slug: "generated",
                    noticeText: "AI Personalized Content"
                    title: "Personalized Content Suggestions",
                    body: "Our AI algorithms analyze your browsing behavior to provide personalized content suggestions."
                },
                {
                    slug: "recommended",
                    noticeText: "AI Recommended Content"
                    title: "Recommended Products",
                    body: "Our AI system recommends products based on your browsing history and preferences."
                }
            ]
        }
    }
});
```

## Notice HTML Attribute

The notice element is a simple way to display AI-generated content notices on the page. You can add a notice to any element by adding the `data-ai-content` attribute with the section slug as the value. For example:

```html
<div data-ai-content="generated">...</div>
```

You can position the notice element by adding the `data-agcn-position` attribute with one of the following values:

- `left` (default)
- `right`
- `center`
